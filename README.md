#### Revealing Galactic Arms!

- Utilized transfer learning with the pre-trained ResNet50 model on ImageNet for galaxy image analysis.
- Tested and classified one million images for galaxies with arms using the ResNet50 model.
- Implemented a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to enhance galaxy images, specifically emphasizing their intricate arms.
- Outlined galaxy arms on one hundred thousand images using the cGAN.
- Future prospects involve scripting for automated arm counting and curvature analysis, aiming for a comprehensive galactic study to further explore the mysteries of the cosmos.
